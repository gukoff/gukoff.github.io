My name is **Konstantin Gukov**, and I live in Switzerland with my wife, son and a cat :)

I am passionate about empowering others and solving problems, and it's even better when these two go hand in hand.

Now at **Microsoft**, I mainly do projects for the Fortune 500 companies.
These solutions use whatever technical stack best suits the problem,
but always use Azure infrastructure.

Before I worked at **Google** in the Identity SRE team (responsible for [critical Google infrastructure](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25472455)), and at **Yandex** doing product development for [Yandex.Travel](https://travel.yandex.ru) (great times!).
