# Who am I?

I am **Konstantin Gukov**, a software engineer in the broad sense of the word.
I'm curious about everything, and happen to have worked with a lot of technologies
throughout my career. The large missing part in my hard skills is the front-end, but I hope
to pick up some while working on this blog :)

# What I do

Mainly I designed, developed and maintained back-end services and APIs.

But at different points in time I also happened to:

- lead small teams;
- host interns;
- give conference talks;
- set up machine learning pipelines;
- conduct statistical analysis on Big Data;
- migrate services from bare metal to the containerized cloud;
- set up monitoring and alerting;
- extensively work with both SQL and NoSQL databases, mainly MySQL, Memcached and MongoDB;
- manually troubleshoot prod services with the close-to-kernel tools like
  [perf](http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html) and
  [tcpdump](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/04/29/new-zine--let-s-learn-tcpdump/)
  , and so on.

# My career so far

The last 5.5 years I spent at the rather large companies: Yandex and Google.

At Yandex, I worked in a SWE role for 3.5 years. Most of the time I spent working at
[Yandex.Flights](https://flights.yandex.com/) and on its integration with
[Yandex.Search](https://yandex.com/).
I was super lucky to have just the right colleagues to learn from,
just the right projects to grow as an engineer, and a lot of freedom.
This let me climb the career ladder very quickly, and I left the company shortly after being
promoted to a staff position.

At Google, I worked as an SRE for 2 years. I didn't code much, but instead wrote and reviewed design
documents, was on-call and took care that Google services are uniform and the developers adhere
to the best practices. I learned quite a bit about system architecture and cloud design patterns -
it was a very useful experience I'm glad I have and I recommend everyone. But ultimately
this work, very far from the customer, with strictly internal impact and little room for creativity,
didn't spark joy :)

My next stop is the
[CSE team](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/CSE.html) at Microsoft -
the customer-facing department focused on solving concrete problems in the large industries.
A typical CSE project would be
[autonomous vehicles at car factories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAUTJa7Nrdc),
but also there are gems like
[preventing rhino poaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTyehRSNxpE)
in South Africa!
